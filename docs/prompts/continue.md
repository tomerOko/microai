please generate the 'rating & reviews' code 

implement placeholder functions yourself 

dont ever use comments instead of code (like 'paste the code here', instead of the actual code)

do not forget tomeroko3-events package validation files like you did for the rest of the services: 
shared validations
request response validations
request response types
event names
event validations
event type
db validation
pathMaps

add comments to explain the bussines logic you chosen if needed

write the actual consumers logic.
