you did not provided the tomeroko3-events package validation files like you did for the rest of the services: 
shared validations
request response validations
request response types
event names
event validations
event type
db validation
pathMaps
write all the code please. dont do this: // Similarly define updatePaymentMethod, removePaymentMethod, addPayoutMethod,
// updatePayoutMethod, removePayoutMethod, createPaymentRecord, createPayoutRecord.
 

make sure all the service files are using validations and types from the tomeroko3-events package.
