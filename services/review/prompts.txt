ok good job, few improvements

1. you didnt handled user creation and user update and didnt saved the users data
2. reviews are per consultant per topic
3. we need an endpoints to get the consultant average ratings and the ratings themselves (with pagination)
4. we also need a similar endpoint but for a specific topic
