13. Business Logic Explanation
Managing WebSocket Connections
Establishing Connections:

Clients (students and consultants) establish a WebSocket connection to the Sockets Service.
Upon connection, clients must authenticate using a JWT token.
The authenticateSocket middleware verifies the token and attaches user information to the socket.
After successful authentication, clients can register their connection details using the setConnection endpoint.
Associating Connections:

Each WebSocket connection is associated with a user (student or consultant) and stored in the userConnections collection.
This association allows the service to send real-time updates to specific users based on their active connections.
Handling Disconnections:

When a client disconnects, the service logs the disconnection and removes the corresponding connection from the database.
Handling Incoming Messages
Message Routing:

Clients can send messages to other users (e.g., students sending messages to consultants).
The sendMessage event handler routes the message to the intended recipient by emitting it to their active connections.
Placeholder functions are implemented to fetch user details and manage message routing logic.
Logging Messages:

All sent messages can be logged in the notificationLogs collection for auditing and troubleshooting.
Broadcasting Events
Real-Time Updates:
The service listens to events from other services via RabbitMQ (e.g., PAYMENT_PROCESSED, REVIEW_ADDED).
Upon receiving these events, the service sends real-time notifications to relevant clients.
For example, when a payment is processed, the service sends a confirmation to the student; when a new review is added, it notifies the consultant.
Handling Notifications
Integration with Notifications Service:
The Sockets Service can work alongside the Notifications Service to provide both real-time and persistent notifications.
While the Notifications Service handles sending emails, SMS, etc., the Sockets Service ensures that connected clients receive instant updates.
Security and Authentication
JWT Authentication:
All WebSocket connections must be authenticated using JWT tokens to ensure that only authorized users can establish connections.
The authenticateSocket middleware handles the verification of tokens and associates user information with the socket.
Scalability and Extensibility
Event-Driven Architecture:
The service leverages RabbitMQ for handling events, allowing it to scale horizontally by adding more instances to handle increased load.
Modular Design:
The code is organized into controllers, services, data access layers, and utilities, making it easy to maintain and extend functionality.
Adding New Features:
New real-time features (e.g., real-time chat, status updates) can be added by implementing additional event handlers and corresponding client-side listeners.
Placeholder Functions
sendMessage:

This function handles routing messages between users.
Placeholder comments indicate where actual message storage and routing logic should be implemented.
getUserByID and getConsultantByID:

These functions are placeholders to retrieve user and consultant details.
In a real-world scenario, they would fetch data from a Users Service or directly from the database.
Notification Sending Functions:

While the Notifications Service handles sending emails and SMS, the Sockets Service focuses on real-time updates via WebSockets.
